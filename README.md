# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub!

### About Me
I am an Information Technology professional with vast experience.

Currently, I create Business Intelligence through Data Analytics to facilitate profitable decisions and I manage Information Systems to ensure alignment of IT Investments with Business Objectives.
I work to amplify business value by driving a culture of doing more with less, and I am also a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast.


### What to Expect
Most of all, I am keen to learn from the great minds here, specifically about Data Science.
I will also share some  use cases as I encounter in my daily work from time to time.
